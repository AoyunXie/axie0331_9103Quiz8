## Part 1

*“Sensing Streams – invisible, inaudible”* by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Daito Manabe visualizes invisible data like radio waves in abstract, immersive ways. I’m inspired by how it lets users explore a dynamic data landscape through interactive systems. 
I want to  create a 3D environment for my project, where visuals respond to audio input in real time. The piece’s audio-reactive visuals and time-based transitions align well with the project requirements, and I’m drawn to how it merges abstract aesthetics with data-driven spatial interaction.

## Part 2

I’m planning to combine `orbitControl()` and `p5.FFT()` in p5.js to build a 3D environment and users can freely change the view to explore the space. This setup also helps create the structure of the audio visible. I’m also exploring other technical tools that could better support this project's final goals.
